# timestamp_app
Made for a project in Comp Systems Research Seminar. Tracks file uploads for date/time created and last accessed, creates timestamp and displays older fles in red and newer files in green when one is selected, When a file is downloaded it becomes "accessed" and the timestamp will update along with the "date_accessed" and "time_accessed" in database. Uses php sql and JS.
